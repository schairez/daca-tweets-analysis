(1/12)\n---\nEmails show Trump sycophant @BenCarsonHS lied when he claimed that HUD hadn’t changed policy on DACA recipients.

If you are undocumented, DACA recipient, or live in a mixed status household please leave. Your support is appreciated but your safety comes first. PLEASE SHARE!\n---\nIn the midst of all of this, the Supreme Court is about to rule on DACA. Most Court watchers expect DACA to be overturned and 700K-800K young Immigrant Dreamers lose their protection, their jobs, their ability to stay in the only country they know. This is morally wrong. SPEAK.\n---\nA particularly silly attempt by CIS to smear DREAMers. They can only come up with 13 examples of serious crimes committed by a DACA recipient since 2012, or .0002% of the ~800,000 people granted DACA. In other words, 99.9998% of DACA recipients had no major issues with the law. \n---\n#DontLookAway As the Supreme Court decision on the fate of #DACA looms closer, new documents show that the Trump admin moved to block young undocumented immigrants from federal housing loans in 2018.

The White House will deny it right up until they shove it down our throats. Jared Kusher has been working for months on a 600+ page immigration/amnesty bill. Amnesty coming in second term. \n---\nI’m not going to lie, I forgot the decision about #DACA is happening this month.

Pls spread the tweet before for awareness!\n---\nDACA Illegal Aliens Among 200 People Arrested in Phoenix, Arizona Riots https://bit.ly/3dBsQBx via @BreitbartNews @JxhnBinder\n---\nOne year ago today, the House passed the Dream and Promise Act to ensure permanent protections for #DACA, TPS, and DED recipients. One year later, this bipartisan bill is more important than ever as DACA recipients wait on SCOTUS to determine their fate.\n---\nThe Trump Administration Said It Didn’t Change Policy To Deny Housing Loans To DACA Recipients. Emails Show Otherwise. https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nidhiprakash/trump-daca-housing-loans-ben-carson via @nidhiprakash &amp; @Haleaziz\n---\nSTRONGLY monitoring the many wonderful (brave) protests to address racial inequities and white comfort. Working hard to save DACA as well! \n---\nScoop w/ @Haleaziz — Internal HUD documents show that officials absolutely changed their policy to exclude DACA recipients from federally-backed housing loans, the whole time Ben Carson was denying it to Congress https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nidhiprakash/trump-daca-housing-loans-ben-carson\n---\n White House Denies DACA Amnesty Extension Coming Before Election: 'Totally False' Unlikely this issue is going anywhere from here on forward–especially as the nation reels from the effects of the coronavirus paired with riots tearing apart US cities. \n---\nUPDATE: A senior White House official on Thursday denied reports that there any discussions about extending the executive amnesty program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), before the election. https://trib.al/yKeXiEx\n---\nI strongly believe that before the election, Trump will announce a landmark peace deal in the Middle East and a DACA deal that even Patriots will like. Thus winning over 2 more Democrat strongholds, the Jews and the Hispanics. #WWG1WGA\n---\n My friends consider this.The DACA folks are not US Citizens.Question ,since DACA has recognition of some note even though illegal ( not born in the US ) how many have a green card and are on the pathway to Citizenship?Where are the parents residing ? https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/06/04/white-house-denies-daca-amnesty-extension-coming-before-election-totally-false/\n---\nDACA Illegal Aliens Among 200 People Arrested in Phoenix, Arizona Riots. ⁦@POTUS⁩ ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ Incase you were thinking on giving them citizenship please make them go to the back of the line like everyone else. https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/06/03/daca-illegal-aliens-among-200-people-arrested-in-phoenix-arizona-riots/\n---\nToday, there are nearly 800,000 DACA illegal aliens living in the U.S. and another more than two million illegal aliens who would be eligible for a DACA amnesty if it were passed into law. https://trib.al/IMz5zWO\n---\nMore than 200,000 DACA recipients are fighting this pandemic on the front lines. And yet President Trump still wants to remove them from the only place they know as home. It's been a year since the House passed the Dream and Promise Act. The Senate needs to act now. #HomeIsHere\n---\n3) There is no expectation at this time that amnesty will be on table. Perhaps it will be offered for the existing DACA recipients, those in good standing, to stay, in exchange for a ton of what we want. No chance we extend DACA or consider wider amnesty. So relax &amp; if possible;\n---\n1) So, after a few phone calls, I can explain the chatter about “evil Globalist Jared Kushner” pushing for a DACA amnesty deal!!! Which, is of course, bullshit. Fact is, SCOTUS has a better than 50/50 chance of ruling that Trump has power to undo Obama EO on DACA. After that;\n---\nThere should never be a DACA amnesty extension, period.\n---\nLet me be clear I LOVE MY @POTUS But I don’t love some of his advisors. I don’t like that Jared likes Amnesty 4 DACA since day 1. I don’t like that Ivanka likes gun control measures like Red Flag Law I don’t like cheap labor 4 women or otherwise These are Democrat policies.\n---\nThere are more than 10,000 Black DACA recipients and over 50,000 Black TPS holders who deserve the permanent protection offered in #HR6: The Dream and Promise Act. Join us in urging the Senate to pass the Act and deliver justice now! #Faith4DACA #Faith4TPS #BlackLivesMatter\n---\n\"While White House is formally denying these reports of coming amnesty deal, others on Capitol Hill suggested there have been rumblings of such meetings.\" Breitbart confirming DACA talks. \n---\nUSCIS disclosed recently that 10% of DACA approvals had an arrest record. 79,398 were approved for DACA with arrest records: https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/Static_files/DACA_Requestors_IDENT_Nov._2019.pdf\n---\nAll of you being led to attack Kushner over DACA are being led astray by fake news from Emerald Robinson. Emerald is another controlled opposition person...sorry guys \n---\nHow do I reconcile THAT #BarackObama signed the Blue Lives Matter bill DACA, and advocated for same-sex marriage but signed nothing for #ADOS ? How do I do that?\n---\nA senior White House official on Thursday denied reports that there any discussions about extending the executive amnesty program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), before the election. https://trib.al/6C2i84l\n---\nIn the meantime, all this would do is reveal the WH's fear of political backlash *if they get want they want* and SCOTUS lets DACA die. There are not enough dimensions to describe this kind of chess.\n---\nDemocrats refused to deal on DACA (something Trump could keep in place with, literally, a pen stroke) when the WH was in a much stronger position. If they think Biden's taking over in seven months, the WH really has no leverage. \n---\nWill you vote for @realDonaldTrump in #Election2020 if he passes Kushner's DACA amnesty bill? Please retweet for larger sample size.\n---\nSo Kushner is working on a DACA amnesty deal? This is not what I voted for, @realDonaldTrump. There is no push to do this except by liberals in your administration. Trump supporters want the economy restored, mail-in voting stopped, freedom of speech restored, &amp; the wall built.\n---\nWith reports that Jared Kushner is working on an amnesty deal, let’s revisit this video. President Trump: \"I want Dreamers to come from the U.S. I want the people in the U.S. who have children, I want them to have dreams.\" Let DACA end. #NeverAmnesty\n---\nThis makes perfect sense given what we know about Jared Kushner’s interests. And between the expected Supreme Court DACA ruling as early as Monday and Congress’s upcoming campaign recess, the clock is running out for #AmericaLast to do an amnesty deal. #FireJared, he needs to go.\n---\nWhat in the blank...No DACA @realDonaldTrump Sorry Ivanka and Jared need to leave the WH.\n---\nA DACA deal will bring some real riots. \n---\nAmnesty is coming by November. First for DACA and possibly a few million more. The GOP sees this as a chance to make inroads. Those that put them in power to do the opposite have no one else to vote for.\n---\nBREAKING: sources confirm that White House advisor Jared Kushner has been holding meetings on DACA amnesty deal - with a goal of getting it done before the 2020 election.\n---\n3 DACA Illegal Aliens and 1 prior deportee Among 200 People Arrested in Phoenix, Arizona Riots.
