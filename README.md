# Social Media Analytics for Twitter Sentiment and Entity Recognition

## Description

Mining Twitter data related to DACA. My interest is to examine the sentiment and context behind Tweets related to DACA issues and to guage the perceptions of American twitter users when discussing DACA recipients and their struggles. I want an unbiased understanding of what entities are frequently associated with DACA tweets.See below for resources related to DACA and the Twitter Streams API. I'm currently using historical twitter data and building my NLP-related functionality. More coming soon. You're welcome to ping me with any questions :)

## Disclaimer

This project is not a means of swaying anyone in a pro-DACA direction, it's just me detecting trends related to DACA tweets, both negative and positive, and detecting what topics are often discussed tangentially when discussing DACA.

### Why this is relevant

There are over 700,000 DACA recipients, myself included, that are living in limbo, awaiting a penultimate decision that will seal our future stake in the U.S. June 2020's Supreme Court decision was a sigh of relief, but not a final verdict on the future of DACA. When DACA was enacted in 2012, I was 17, I raised my expectations of what I could achieve in my life. DACA afforded me a Work Authorization Card, and in-state tuition in CA. I attended college and pursued higher education like my U.S. citizen counterparts. I have a work authorizaiton, that I continually renew every 2 years, but ever since the Trump administration denounced the program in 2017, my future expectations have been bleak. There are many fascinating stories of DACA recipients, many of whom defied all odds and expectations, and I encourage you to educate yourself on the issue.
